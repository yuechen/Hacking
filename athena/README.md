Athena Health Coding Challenge 2013
===================================

This was the challenge given to me by Athena Health in Jan, 2013. For challenge prompt, see challenge.pdf.

athena.py is a prototype built in Python.
athena.c is the actual solution built in C.

The solution solves the T(10,4) problem in 1.6 seconds on a Macbook Pro Mid-2010 with 2.66 GHz Intel i7 Dual-Core Processor with Mac OS X Mountain Lion. It was compiled with gcc 4.2.1 on the same Mac with the -O2 flag. The value it computes is 2329.
